# Author-Identification-System

## My bachelor's capstone 

### Overview 
A complete desktop-application developed in Python that performs **Authorship Attribution**. Given a labeled corpus of newspaper articles, we train a model by extracting stylometry features from text with TF-IDF weighing and stemming techniques, and classify the correct author using cosine similarity, KNN and SVM classifiers. 


## Dataset  
For our datasets with around 50-100k sentences, it takes about 5 minutes to train the model on a local CPU while reaching an accuracy of about 70-80% for test data. 


## Tools and Technologies 
Programming Language is **PYTHON** whereas the tool Used is **Python Shell 3.5**.
