# Author-Identification-System
A complete desktop-application developed in Python that performs Authorship Attribution. Given a labeled corpus of newspaper articles, we train a model by extracting stylometry features from text with TF-IDF weighing and stemming techniques, and classify the correct author using cosine similarity, KNN and SVM classifiers. For the dataset with 100k sentences, it takes about 5 minutes to train the model on a local CPU while reaching an accuracy of about 70-80% for test data.
