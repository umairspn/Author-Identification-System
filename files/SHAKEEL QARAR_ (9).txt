Four anti-terrorism squad (ATS) personnel were taken into custody by Islamabad police for "fatally shooting a citizen" in Rawal Town on Wednesday night.

A first investigation report (FIR) has been registered at the Shahzad Town police station and the homicide department is investigating the case.

According to the FIR, Inayat Shah and Ijaz Shah were on their way to Margalla Town when the ATS personnel signalled them to stop the car.

Once the car stopped, the ATS personnel opened fire at the two men, killing Inayat on the spot and injuring Ijaz, according to Inayat's son who registered the FIR.

Earlier this year in February, a young man was fatally shot by a police officer in Islamabad's Sector I-10/1 in the early hours of Friday, allegedly after failing to stop at a checkpoint.

Taimur received at least one bullet injury to the head after Samiullah Niazi of the police's Eagle Squad opened fire on his vehicle.

The officer had fled the scene after the incident. Police said they had initiated a search for the suspect.

At the time, police officials had said that the officer had opened fire at Taimur after his refusal to stop the vehicle.

The incident had sparked rioting and protests on Islamabad's IJP Road at the time, with the victim's family dismissing the police statement and saying there had been no prior warning or order to stop before the officer opened fire.

In January 2016, a youth in Karachi was shot dead by police officials for allegedly not stopping at a check post in the Gizri area.

The two police officials on duty – Altaf and Mudassir – were been taken into custody.
