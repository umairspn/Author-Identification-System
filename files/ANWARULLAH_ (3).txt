KHAR: A Pakistani solider was injured in firing by militants from Afghanistan’s Kunar province on a security post in Nawagai tehsil of Bajaur Agency on Tuesday morning.

Official sources said that militants from across the border opened fire on the post located in the border area of Charmang, some 35km northwest of Khar, the agency’s headquarters. They said the attackers used heavy weapons. Soldiers manning the post returned fire and forced the attackers to retreat, they added.

The sources said that militants who had their hideouts in Afghanistan’s Kunar province had attacked several Pakistani security posts in border areas over the past three days.

However, soldiers deployed at these posts had repulsed all those attacks, they added.

No group has so far claimed responsibility for Tuesday’s attack, but authorities here believe that militants who are active in Kunar province are usually behind such attacks.
