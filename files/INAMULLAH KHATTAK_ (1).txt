Ishaq Dar's motorcade arrives at the accountability court.— DawnNews
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar is appearing before an accountability court in Islamabad for the seventh time as his trial resumes in the reference filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against him.

The NAB prosecution has presented two new witnesses against the minister today. They are being cross-examined by Dar's counsel Khawaja Haris.

The witnesses are providing details of different bank accounts held by Dar in the country.

The court had on Wednesday adjourned the hearing of the graft cases till October 23 after the minister's senior counsel left the country in a rush earlier the same day.

In the preceding hearing of the case, Haris had cross-questioned Al-Baraka Islamic Bank's Assistant Vice President Tariq Javed — the prosecution's third witness.

The court had indicted Dar last month in a NAB reference pertaining to his owning assets "beyond his known sources of income”.

'Assets beyond known income'
On July 28, a five-member Supreme Court bench had ordered NAB to file three references against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and one against Dar, on petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Imran Khan, Jamaat-i-Islami’s Sirajul Haq and Awami Muslim League’s Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.

In its reference against the finance minister, NAB has alleged that “the accused has acquired assets and pecuniary interests/resources in his own name and/or in the name of his dependants of an approximate amount of Rs831.678 million (approx)”.

The reference alleged that the assets were “disproportionate to his known sources of income for which he could not reasonably account for”.
