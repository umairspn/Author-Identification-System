The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Thursday arrested Sibtain Kazmi for the murder of Maulana Azam Tariq, former chief of the Millat-i-Islamia - now known as the banned Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat.

Maulana Azam Tariq was assasinated in 2003.

Kazmi, whose name had been placed on the Exit Control List, was apprehended by FIA officials at Islamabad airport while attempting to flee to Manchester via Doha on a Qatar airlines flight, FIA officials said.

The government had declared Rs1 million head money for Kazmi.

Maulana Azam Tariq, chief of the Millat-i-Islamia and an MNA, was gunned down in Islamabad in Oct 2003.

Tariq, who was travelling from Jhang to attend a National Assembly session, was intercepted by three assailants who sprayed bullets at his car with AK-47 assault rifles. He received 40 bullet wounds mostly in the head and cervical region, and all five people in the car died on the spot.

Tariq previously headed Anjuman Sipah-i-Sahaba, which was banned by President Musharraf because of allegations of sectarian violence. It changed its name to Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan in 1989, and then to Millat-i-Islamia in 2002. It is now known as the banned Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat.

Tariq was elected to the NA during 2002's elections as an independent candidate. Despite being a religious leader, he refused to join Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal, a conglomerate of six religious parties.
