Lawyer Hamid Khan on Friday requested the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan to excuse him from representing PTI for litigation of the Panama Papers case in the Supreme Court of Pakistan, DawnNews reported.

Hamid Khan submitted the application to the PTI chief, and said the media campaign against him made it impossible for him to continue representing PTI in the apex court.

“After the media campaign it is not possible for me to continue representing PTI in the supreme court,” read the application submitted by Hamid Khan.

Meanwhile, it was confirmed by a senior PTI leader that the decision has been taken to change the lawyer for the Panama Papers case.

“Decision regarding the change of lawyer has been taken but it will be announced on Monday or Tuesday,” said a PTI leader, who wished not to be named.

“Hamid Khan has been requested to humbly step down from the position,” added the PTI leader.

Rumours have been circling on media since yesterday that PTI has decided to change its prosecutor for the Panama case. However, PTI leadership had earlier rejected the rumours and termed them “false”.

A panel of senior lawyers including Hamid Khan and Naeem Bokhari were representing the PTI in the supreme court for litigation of Panama Papers case.

The apex court on Tuesday questioned the quality of the evidence presented by the PTI and deplored that their 680-page submission had almost nothing to do with the Sharif family’s London properties.

“We are at a loss to understand which lawyer is representing whom,” the judge observed, comparing the PTI’s tome of evidence to the never-ending tales from the Arabian Nights. We spent six hours simply looking for the relevant document,” Justice Saeed deplored on Tuesday, asking Hamid Khan again — tongue-in-cheek — whose side he was on.

The case’s latest hearing held on November 17 and it was adjourned to November 30.
