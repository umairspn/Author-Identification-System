KHAR: Security forces claimed on Friday to have repulsed an attack on their checkposts in border areas of Nawagai tehsil in Bajaur Agency by militants from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.

“At least two militants were injured as security forces successfully repulsed the cross-border attack in several areas of Nawagai in the small hours of Friday,” security officials said.
