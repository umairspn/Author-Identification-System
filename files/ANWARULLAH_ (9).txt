KHAR/GHALANAI: Security forces on Friday repulsed attacks on two security checkposts in Mohmand and Bajaur tribal agencies by militants who came from across the Afghan border.

Official sources told Dawn that militants from Kunar province of Afghanistan attacked the Shiekh Baba checkpost in Safi tehsil of Mohmand tribal region early in the morning (4.30am) and a security post in Nawa Pass area of Chamarkund, some 45km northwest of the agency headquarters Khar, at 11.30am.

However, they said, security personnel manning the checkposts retaliated effectively and repulsed the attacks. Both sides used heavy and light weapons as the clashes continued for several hours.

No casualties were reported in both attacks.

An official of the political administration in Bajaur told Dawn that militants fired several rockets on the post. He said the administration had launched an investigation into the incident.

Answering a question, the officials claimed that militants hiding in an Afghanistan area could be responsible for the attack, adding that militants from Afghanistan had been involved in such attacks in the past.

Jamaatul Ahrar, an offshoot of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the attacks.

A leader of the militant group told reporters by phone from an unspecified location that members of his group were responsible for the attacks.
