Former Senior Superintendent of Police, Islamabad, Mohammad Ali Nekokara has been exonerated after three years when he was dismissed from his service reportedly for not using force against anti-government protesters.

The Establishment Division, after approval of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, issued a notification in this regard, a copy of which is available with DawnNews.

Nekokara had appealed the prime minister, asking the premier to withdraw penalty against him. Earlier the officer had also approached judiciary but could not avail any relief.

The notification reads that after approval from the premier, "major penalty of 'dismissal from service' imposed upon Mohammad Ali Nekokara is set aside" and the officer is exonerated.

"The intervening period shall be treated as a leave of this kind due, subject to title," the notifications reads.

Earlier in 2015, the notification for his dismissal stated that he had been removed over "inefficiency and misconduct".

In August last year, Nekokara had written a detailed letter to Interior Secretary Shahid Khan, emphasising the importance of not using force when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Awami Tehreek 
(PAT) announced their decision to march on Parliament House.
