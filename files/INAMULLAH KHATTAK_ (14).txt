An accountability court on Wednesday summoned former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his children - Maryam, Hassan and Hussain Nawaz - to appear on September 19 in a reference pertaining to the Sharif family's company, Flagship Investment Limited, in the UK.

Last week, in compliance with the Supreme Court verdict in the Panama Papers case, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had filed the reference along with two other corruption references against Nawaz and his children in relation to 16 companies owned by the family abroad.

A fourth corruption reference was also filed against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar for possessing assets beyond his known sources of income

Along with the corruption references, NAB had also submitted a copy of the report compiled by the joint investigation team (JIT) that probed allegations of money laundering against the Sharif family.

The bureau also submitted the investigations it had conducted against the Sharif family members.

In the light of the JIT report, the apex court on July 28 had disqualified Nawaz Sharif as prime minister and directed NAB to complete the investigation process and file references against the Sharif family in six weeks.

NAB had previously summoned the Sharif family members to appear before it for a probe pertaining to their business concerns.

However, Nawaz and his children failed to do so stating they would not appear before NAB till a verdict on the review petitions filed in the SC challenging the July 28 verdict that disqualified the former premier is decided.
