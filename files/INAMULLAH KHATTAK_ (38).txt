Adviser to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz on Wednesday informed the Senate that evidence was being collected regarding the role of Indian spy Kulbushan Jadhav in Pakistan.

Aziz was briefing the Senate about Pak-India relations and skirmishes along the Line of Control (LoC).

“So far, we have just statements about the involvement of the Indian spy in terror activities in Pakistan,” said Aziz.

The adviser added that further evidence needs to be gathered.

Aziz also told the Senate that the United Nations has been provided a dossier regarding the involvement of Indian intelligence agency RAW in Pakistan. He added that the Senate will be informed soon about progress.

Jhadav's arrest and confessions
Law enforcement agencies had announced the arrest of Jadhav during an intelligence-based raid in Balochistan's Chaman last month.

The Indian Foreign Ministry had confirmed that the arrested man was a former Indian Navy officer, but the Pakistani government claimed to have recovered travel documents and multiple fake identities of Jadhav, establishing him as an Indian spy who entered into Balochistan through Iran — holding a valid Iranian visa.

In a video shown to media during a joint press conference by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) head Lt Gen Asim Bajwa and Federal Information Minister Pervez Rashid on March 31 Kulbushan Jadhav confessed to involvement in terror activities in Balochistan and Karachi.

After Jadhav's arrest, Pakistan summoned Indian High Commissioner Gautam Bambawale to lodge a strong protest over 'India's spying activities' in Pakistan, besides apprising the international community about the arrest.
