The Punjab government on Tuesday issued orders for the constitution of a high-powered joint investigation team (JIT) to investigate the Ferozepur Road bombing in Lahore.

At least 26 people, nine policemen among them, were killed and 54 others injured in a suicide bomb explosion near the Arfa Karim IT Tower on Ferozepur Road on Monday afternoon.

According to initial reports, a bomber rammed his explosives-laden motorbike into over 100 policemen and as many other people who had gathered during an anti-encroachment drive initiated by the Lahore Development Authority in the Kot Lakhpat Fruit Mandi.

The blast took place a few hundred yards from the Punjab chief minister’s 80-H, Model Town residence, sending a wave of panic in the vicinity.

Tuesday evening, the Punjab Home Department invoked Section 19(I) of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 to constitute a JIT to "probe and finalize investigation" in the bombing attack case.

A notification to this effect stated that the five-member JIT would have a Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) representative as convener, while representatives of Inter-Services Intelligence, the Intelligence Bureau, the Criminal Investigation Agency and CTD would be members.
