TIMERGARA / KHAR: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif directed the National Disa­ster Management Authority and the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa government on Monday to complete by Nov 14 the payment of compensation to people affected by the recent earthquake.

During a visit to Timergara in Lower Dir, he said the federal and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa governments had dec­ided to complete the process by Nov 4 but later it was felt that the NDMA and Pro­vincial Disaster Manage­ment Authority would not be able to get in touch with every affected person by that date because the task was huge.

He asked the authorities concerned to complete the distribution of cheques by Nov 14 because winter was round the corner.

Earlier, KP Chief Minister Pervez Khattak received the prime minister as he landed at the Dir Scouts ground.

Governor Mehtab Ahmed Khan, Minister for Information Pervez Rashid, PML-N’s senior vice president Ameer Muqam and the NDMA chairman accompanied Mr Sharif.

Malakand GOC Maj Gen Nadar Khan briefed the prime minister on losses caused by the quake. He said 15,000 houses were destroyed and 44,000 partially damaged in Malakand division. He said 20,000 tents and 25,000 blankets and foodstuff and relief goods had so far been distributed among the affected people.

Addressing a jirga of elders in Khar, the headquarters of Bajaur Agency, the prime minister said his government was aware of the problems and difficulties being faced by the affected people.
