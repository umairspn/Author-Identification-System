KHAR: Three people were killed and 24 others injured when a roadside bomb hit their vehicle in the mountainous Nawagai tehsil of Bajaur Agency on Friday.

Officials of the agency’s political administration said that a truck was going from a nearby town to a hilly area of the Charmang Valley when the bomb placed on the roadside at Matak locality was detonated by remote control. The area is along the Pak-Afghan border and some 40km northwest of Khar.

A large number of people thronged the hospital to donate blood for the injured.

Local people said that the blast was heard far and wide in the tehsil.

An official of the local administration told Dawn that six injured — Ali Hazrat, Muhammad Saleem, Khan Zareen, Rahmanullah, Shah Zareen and Gul Zameen — were later sent to Peshawar by an army helicopter because of their critical condition. According to doctors of the agency headquarters hospital, some injured were discharged after providing them first aid.
