Women's Action Forum's (WAF) founding member Lala Rukh passed away at the age of 69 in Lahore on Friday.

Born on June 29, Lala Rukh was diagnosed with cancer last month and passed away at her home in Lahore where she lived with her sister. An activist and campaigner, she remained the head of the art and history departments at the National College of Arts (NCA), Lahore.

A voice for minorities and women, Lala Rukh was a part of the iconic women's protest at Mall Road against General Ziaul Haq's martial law regime and was jailed at that time for her political activities.

Messages of condolence poured in following the news of her death.
"My dearest friend LalaRukh, a dedicated member of Women Action Forum and a lifelong crusader for justice, equality, women's rights and minority rights from a feminist perspective, as well as a renowned artist died peacefully this morning after a month long struggle with cancer. Rest in peace dear Lala - we will miss you so much in WAF, in our lives and you will forever remain alive in our hearts. We love you Lala," author and researcher Rubina Saigol wrote in a public Facebook post.

Her funeral will be held at her sister's residence around 5pm. She will be buried in Miyani Sahib graveyard.
