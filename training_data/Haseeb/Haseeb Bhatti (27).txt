The Sharif family has not submitted any objections before the Supreme Court (SC) to the Panamagate joint investigation team's (JIT) damning report on their murky financial history, DawnNews reported on Saturday.

Sources said the family's legal team is waiting for reports on the credibility of the forensic and financial experts engaged by the JIT, and hopes to come armed to the Monday hearing with that information.

A three-member bench of the SC headed by Justice Ejaz Afzal is set to hear the Panamagate implementation case in the light of JIT report on Monday. The court, on July 10, had ordered the parties to submit their replies by July 17 after reviewing copies of the JIT report.

The SC had also sought transcripts of speeches made by PML-N leaders Saad Rafique, Talal Chaudhry and Asif Kirmani, which were submitted by the attorney general's office before the day's closing.

Transcripts of 15 speeches of the three leaders comprised a total of 106 pages.

Security beefed up at SC
Jamil Hashmi, a senior superintendent of police, said that security around the SC is being beefed up before Monday's hearing.

Additional barbed wires will be installed and the red zone will remain sealed on the day, while only those related to the case will be allowed to enter, Hashmi said.
