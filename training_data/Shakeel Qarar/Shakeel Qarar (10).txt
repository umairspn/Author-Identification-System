The federal government on Thursday placed a ban on the collection of hides of sacrificial animals by proscribed outfits on the eve of Eidul Azha, a list of such organisations has been issued by the Interior Ministry.

The list, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, has been issued by the Ministry of Interior and carries the names of 65 proscribed outfits, including Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan, Lashkar-i-Tayyaba Pakistan, Balochistan National Liberation Army and Rabita Trust.


It has been decided that the organisations interested in collecting hides will have to procure NOCs from the area's Deputy Commissioner.
