Interior Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan on Friday rubbished the impression that he had developed differences with the PML-N leadership.

"Neither did the minister walk out from the last meeting of the cabinet, nor was there any altercation during the session," a statement issued by the interior ministry said.

The spokesperson urged the media to avoid "illogical speculations and unrealistic comments" regarding the minister.

"A section of media ran baseless news in this regard," the statement read.
