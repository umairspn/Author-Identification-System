ISLAMABAD: The Senate is set to adopt on Wednesday (today) a resolution recommending to the government to launch a regional initiative to coordinate response to US President Donald Trump’s new Afghan policy critical of Pakistan’s antiterrorism efforts.

It also suggests that the quadrilateral mechanism comprising Pakistan, Afg­hanistan, China and Tajikistan be made more proactive to play a greater role in countering terrorism in the region.

The house, which converted itself into a committee, gave a final shape to the draft resolution based on the policy guidelines proposed by a six-member subcommittee. After its passage by the Senate, the resolution will be sent to the National Assembly, which is likely to adopt a resolution on the same lines.

Informed sources told Dawn that the draft resolution rejected Trump’s remarks as one-sided and pointed out that it put the entire blame on Pakistan while ignoring its legitimate concerns.

It also wants the security establishment to take note of the United States’ plan to increase the number of its troops in Afghanistan and maintain their presence for an indefinite period. It calls for focusing on border management and security along the border with Afghanistan. It asks the government to prepare a fact sheet on American assistance to Pakistan in order to clear the picture of how much actual reimbursements have been made under the Coalition Support Fund as well as the US failure to supply military hardware and aid on one pretext or the other and the losses incurred by Pakistan since the US war in Afghanistan.

The resolution also wants the government to effectively highlight the Indian interference in Pakistan and refers to militants like Moulvi Fazlullah and others hiding in Afghanistan and operating against Pakistan. Similar allegations by Afghanistan need to be looked into more closely.

It stresses the need for a mutually acceptable verification mechanism to look into acrimonious allegations of cross-border violations that emanate from both Kabul and Islamabad.

During the in-camera proceedings of the Senate Committee of the Whole, members wanted the government to take a firm stand on its principled position that the international community should acknowledge and respect Pakistan’s sacrifices as frontline state in the war on terror instead of accusing Islamabad of harbouring terrorists.

According to the sources, the senators suggested that the government should highlight its sacrifices in the war against terrorism, including loss of invaluable human lives and destruction of its infrastructure, which were colossal than the much-trumpeted US assistance to Pakistan.

They suggested establishment of links with the critics of President Trump in the US Congress and Senate. Pakistan’s viewpoint should not only be conveyed to the friendly countries, but also to the allies of the United States, they said, adding that the US ambassador should be called to the Foreign Office and informed him about the parliamentary proceedings on the issue of Trump’s remarks about Pakistan. The senators asked the government to immediately convene a meeting the parliamentary committee on national security.
